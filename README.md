## State of the application

The application is under development. We plan to deploy it to production in a timelapse of at least 3 months from now on. Stay tuned!

## Stack

Besides `create-react-app`, the application works with the following stack:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) + [Bookshelf.js](http://bookshelfjs.org/)

## Requirements

If you wish to test this application locally, you'll need to install the following beforehand:

* Node.js (8.9.4 or higher)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (1.5.1 or higher) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (5.6.0 or higher)
* PostgreSQL (9.6.5 or higher)

If you wish to use Docker, you'll need:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (18.02.0-ce or higher)
* Docker Compose (1.19.0 or higher)

For now, a `docker-compose.yml` file is not available for Docker-assisted development. If you wish to help us with it, feel free to submit a Pull Request :smile:
